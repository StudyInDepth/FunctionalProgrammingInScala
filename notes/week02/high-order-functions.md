# _Higher-Order Functions_

Functional languages treat functions as first-class values.

That means, like any other value, a function can be passed
as a parameter and returned as a result.

This provides a flexible way to compose programs.

Functions that take other functions as parameters or that
return functions as results are called higher-order functions
